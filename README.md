# OOSDFinalProject
The GitHub repository of my Final Project for class SE-450

Welcome to my Final Project README!

My final project is rather simple to run. This appication can be run from the console. In order to start the application, you need to be in the Main.java class that controls the program. Once you start the program, it is very straightforward. In the console you will have a menu of options to choose from. It is easiest if you work your way from top to bottom.

You must first register with a username, password and email. Once you have created an account you need to log in with the username and password that you had just registered with.

From there, you are able to see the products that available for browsing. Options 4-6 can be categorized as cart management. It is these options that allow you to add a product to your cart, empty your cart if you want to start over, or you can view all of the products that you have in your cart at that moment.

Once you are satisfied with what is in your cart, Option 7 allows you to proceeed to Checkout. Your order will then either be successfully fulfilled and given an order ID, or it will fail and you will need to try again. Once you try again it will be complete and an Order ID will be assigned.

This project was a ton of fun to complete. I can certainly see myself continuing to iteraete upon this project and add features. It was very difficult to get started, however I believe that is the hardest part developing software I have learned. It is great practive for the real world on the cycle of creating software.
